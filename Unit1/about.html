                <h1> Codey Bond</h1>
                <p> Animals are one of my favorite things on the planet.  I only have one animal but I like to think I have 6 animals because my girlfriend also has a bunch of animals.  I have a cat named Jack and my girlfriends cats which are named Patches, Paws, Twix, and Onyx with her dog named Hunter.  When i'm older I plan on getting a lot of animals and want at least 2 or 3 cats with 2 dogs.</p>  

                <h2> Activities for fun</h2>
                <p> Often times at my house I have a ton of free time so I like to try to do fun things to get rid of my boredom.  Some of the things I enjoy doing are eating food, playing video games, and traveling.  My favorite foods to eat are pizza, philly cheese steaks, and mac and cheese, one thing that often sucks is I like to eat my food while i play videogames.  The videogames I play are usually competitive such as rainbow six siege and mostly first person shooters so I get greasy hands while eating and playing.  My favorite thing to do over videogames and eating are traveling,  Traveling is by far my favorite thing and I love exploring new things such as abandoned building, big cities, and other cool places.  I have been to a total of 15 out of the 50 states in the United States of America and unfortunately haven't been out of the country (excluding canada) </p>
                
                <h2> Plans after this year </h2>
                <p> My whole life I have always been interested in doing something with computers or law enforcement.  When I was super young I had really wanted to be a police officer but as I matured and learned more about other jobs through job fairs and school events I had eventually learned about being a Border Patrol Agent.  Some things that had made me interested in being a Border Patrol Agent are me being eligible to carry a handgun at 18, helping others that are in need, and protecting the country because I love America. With computers, I have always been around computers my whole life and I have back problems and so it's difficult to stand up for long periods of time so I feel sitting down and doing things behind a computer or at a desk is up my alley. </p>
