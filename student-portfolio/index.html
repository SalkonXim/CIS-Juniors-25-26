    <!--About me-->
    <h2>Information About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a pending graduate from Norwood Norfolk Central School currently trying to develop better skills for my future.  I am taking Computer and Information Science at Seaway Technical BOCES Center and last year took HVAC-R but I hadn't enjoyed the course that much.  After I graduate I am unsure of what I want to do but one of the main things that I know I am determined about is my relationship.  When I graduate I plan on moving in with my girlfriend Jaylin and getting a job in Ogdensburg.  Honestly I have ideas on what I want my future to look like but am not sure at all what I want to do for a job. </p>
    <p>I am very good at videogames and my favorite type of games are shooter games. I have been playing this game called rainbow six siege for over 8 years and I have been involved in the competitive scene for about 3.  Gaming not only helps me relax and destress, but hel;s me develop skills for my future such as communication because you need very overzealous callouts, very good loyalty by playing with a team a lot to learn how eachother play, and teamwork.  In rainbow six siege all of these are needed and playing the game has helped me develop these skills, which are all essential at jobs and further after high school. </p>
