    <h1>Video Games</h1>
    <p>Video Games are my favorite hobby and one of the main things I do outside of school. I play several games such as clash royale, rainbow six siege, and I used to play other games like Fortnite and Rocket League.  Videogames help me relax and cure my boredom during the day.</p>
