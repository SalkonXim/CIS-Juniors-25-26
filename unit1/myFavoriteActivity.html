        <h1>  Eating food</h1>

    <p> Eating food is my favorite activity.  I enjoy traveling with my family and really just anywhere because I always look for food trucks, good food spots, or really just anything food related.  This is a good thing because I always am full but it is bad because I feel when I have my own money I am going to spend a lot of my money on food because I already do.  Some of the best food places I have been to are world famous pizza shop Reginas in Boston MA, and Raising Canes Golden Version in Boston MA aswell.</p>
