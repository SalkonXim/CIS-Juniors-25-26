    <h1> My main favorite things to do </h1>
    <p> There is many things that I enjoy doing for fun.  Those things can consist of</p>
        <ol>
            <li> Hanging out with my girlfriend </li>
            <li> Eating food </li>
            <li> Traveling </li>
        </ol>
       <p> My favorite of the three is hanging out with my girlfriend.  Over the summer me and her had been together almost every day and the only days we were apart was when I had went on <a href="https://www.bostonteapartyship.com/" target="_blank"> vacation </a>and she had school.  Her name is Jaylin and she is from Ogdensburg.  She goes to <a href="https://www.ogdensburgk12.org/o/ofa" target="_blank">Ogdensburg Free Academy</a> and is in 10th grade (but is turning 16 in a month its not weird), She is the one who pushes me to do everything.  Jaylin encourages me to do my work for school, she encourages me to do my chores, push on with my day, helping me with my mental health problems, and generally just making sure im the best person I can possibly be no matter if we are together or far away.  Another thing I enjoy doing is playing videogames.  The videogame I have been playing for years is Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege and is made by a company called <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us" target="_blank"> Ubisoft</a>.  I have hit top 50 champion several times and am very known in the community playing with certain famous youtubers.</p>
